# Jira ScriptRunner
**ScriptRunner** is a JIRA add-on which allows JIRA admins to modify issue behaviour and automate execution of various tasks by implementing groovy scripts.

## Usage instructions
- Go to [Confluence Page](https://confluence.itcm.oneadr.net/display/PL/Improving+JIRA+project+flow+with+ScriptRunner) for details how to use scripts in this repository
	- This page also contains various hints about ScriptRunner's quirks
- This repository contains script examples with commentaries
- Executing these scripts from this repository won't work - they need to be copied to proper places in JIRA configuration
- Working with these scripts will be a bit easier if you [set up your IDE](https://scriptrunner.adaptavist.com/4.3.5/bitbucket/DevEnvironment.html)
	- You'll still have to copy the scripts to ScriptRunner though
	
	
## To do
- Improve the scripts to make them "prettier" and remove redundant elements. Currently they're just meant to work and handle foreseen cases.
